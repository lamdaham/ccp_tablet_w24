            <p>Unlike Indian or Thai curry, Japanese curry is more savory than spicy. It’s an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan.</p>
            <h2>Recipe Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>1 package curry sauce mix</li>
                <li>1 can peas</li>
                <li>5 new potatoes, halved</li>
                <li>1 package sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 cups jasmine rice</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Recipe Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce mix has completely dissolved.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry sauce over top. Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Macaroni and cheese, commonly known as mac & cheese, is a comfort food staple that has captured the hearts of people all over the world.

                <li>Remove pan from heat and whisk in cheddar, Gruyère, and 1 cup Parmesan until melted and smooth. Stir in macaroni and transfer to the prepared dish.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine panko, oil, and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Sprinkle over macaroni; season with more pepper.</li>
